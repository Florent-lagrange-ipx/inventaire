    "news_1": "Hello! You are currently reading the first edition of your inventaire.io activity summary! Those emails are meant to remind you of books you might have borrowed or lended, to tell you when friends add new books to their inventories, and more! It will also be the occasion to share news and tips on inventaire.io progresses, and lot happened since we went first online in February: [groups](https://inventaire.io/network/groups), [transactions tracker](https://inventaire.io/transactions), improved design... and it's just a start! Thank you for taking part to this adventure :)<br><p style='text-align:right'>Maxime</p>"

    "news_1": "Hello! You are currently reading the first edition of your inventaire.io activity summary! Those emails are meant to remind you of books you might have borrowed or lended, to tell you when friends add new books to their inventories, and more! It will also be the occasion to share news and tips on inventaire.io progresses, and lot happened since we went first online in February: [groups](https://inventaire.io/network/groups), [transactions tracker](https://inventaire.io/transactions), improved design... and it's just a start! Thank you for taking part to this adventure :)<br><p style='text-align:right'>Maxime</p>",
    "news_2": "Hello!<br>Good news, we are making progress toward geolocation features: you can now see the [users nearby](https://inventaire.io/network/users/nearby)! If you want to give the opportunity to other users to see your public books, and eventually send you a request, you can add yourself to the map. It's probably not perfect yet, but it will keep improving in the coming months and, as usual, your feedback is very welcome :)<br><p style='text-align:right'>Maxime</p>",
